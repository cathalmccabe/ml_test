## What is FINN?

|-------|-------|

FINN is an
experimental framework from Xilinx Research Labs to explore deep neural network
inference on FPGAs. 
It specifically targets [quantized neural
networks](https://github.com/maltanar/qnn-inference-examples), with emphasis on
generating dataflow-style architectures customized for each network.
It is not
intended to be a generic DNN accelerator like xDNN, but rather a tool for
exploring the design space of DNN inference accelerators on FPGAs.

## Features
* **Templated Vivado HLS library of streaming components:** FINN comes with an
HLS hardware library that implements convolutional, fully-connected, pooling and
LSTM layer types as streaming components. The library uses C++ templates to
support a wide range of precisions.
* **Ultra low-latency and high performance
with dataflow:** By composing streaming components for each layer, FINN can
generate accelerators that can classify images at sub-microsecond latency.
* **Many end-to-end example designs:** We provide examples that start from training a
quantized neural network, all the way down to an accelerated design running on
hardware. The examples span a range of datasets and network topologies.
* **Toolflow for rapid design generation:** The FINN toolflow supports allocating
separate compute resources per layer, either automatically or manually, and
generating the full design for synthesis. This enables rapid exploration of the
design space.

## Quickstart

Depending on what you would like to do, we have
different suggestions on where to get started:

* **I want to try out premade accelerators on real hardware.** Head over to [BNN-
PYNQ](https://github.com/Xilinx/BNN-PYNQ) repository to try out some image
classification accelerators, or to [LSTM-PYNQ](https://github.com/Xilinx/LSTM-
PYNQ) to try optical character recognition with LSTMs.
* **I want to try the full design flow.** The [FINN](https://github.com/Xilinx/LSTM-PYNQ) repository
contains the Python toolflow that goes from a trained, quantized Caffe network
to an accelerator running on real hardware.
* **I want to train new quantized networks for FINN.** Have a look at 
[this presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17oorGvtUbdFd-o1OzSuxGCSrWsvm_S2ftC1UC2FLtuE) 
for an example with Fashion-MNIST, or [here](https://github.com/Xilinx/pytorch-ocr) for quantized 
LSTMs with PyTorch.
* **I want to understand how it all fits together.** Check out our [publications](#publications), 
particularly the [FINN paper at FPGA'17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07119) and the [FINN-R paper in ACM TRETS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04570).

## Neural Network Demos

Multiple Jupyter notebooks examples are provided, with different datasets and two architectures:

* **Feed-forward Dataflow**: all layers of the network are
implemented in the hardware, the output of one layer is the input of the
following one that starts processing as soon as data is available. The network
parameters for all layers are cached in the on-chip memory. For each network
topology, a customized hardware implementation is generated that provides low
latency and high throughput.

* **Dataflow with loopback**: a fixed hardware
architecture is implemented, being able to compute multiple layers in a single
call. The complete network is executed in multiple calls, which are scheduled on
the same hardware architecture. Changing the network topology implies changing
the runtime scheduling, but not the hardware architecture. This provides a
flexible implementation but features slightly higher latency.

Our design
examples are mostly for the [PYNQ](http://www.pynq.io/) Z1 and Z2 boards, and a
few for the Ultra96. Future support for AWS F1 and other Xilinx platforms is
also planned.
